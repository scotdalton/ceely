# Music Software Projects - Ear Memory


## The Game
### Overview
Ear Memory is game that tests the player's "ear memory",
i.e. the ability to discern and remember a sequence of
random notes played from a selected scale :musical_keyboard: 

Players advance through trickier levels of difficulty
and gain 10 points for each correct answer.

### Details
#### Levels
- __Noob__:
  Noobs will see and hear three notes played, with the note names for guidance.
- __Beginner__:
Beginners will see and hear five notes played, with the note names for guidance.
- __Beginner Plus__
Just like Beginner but with beats :headphones:
- __Intermediate__
Intermediate players will see and hear five note played, but without the note names for guidance.
- __Intermediate Plus__
Just like Intermediate but with beats :headphones:
- __Advanced__
Advanced players will only hear seven note played.
They will not see the keys played, nor will the names be available to them guidance.

#### Options
Players can elect to "Play the scale first" in which
case the selected scale will be played before the random
sequence of notes. This is intended to allow players
to ground themselves in the sounds of the scale.
